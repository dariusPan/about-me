Minimal singleâ€‘file site. Edit `index.html` and replace images under `images/`.
- Update captions where you see `<!-- EDIT: ... -->` comments.
- Toggle dark/light with the ðŸŒ— button (persists in localStorage).
- You can host this on OCI Object Storage as a static website (set index to `index.html`).
